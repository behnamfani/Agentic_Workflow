with no middle men – meaning, no banks!
Bitcoin can be used to book hotels, shopping
and etc. But much of the hype is about
getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin
skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.

Owning Bitcoins
 Bitcoins are stored in a “digital wallet,” which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s
computer. The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive
bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. Unlike bank accounts, bitcoin wallets are not
insured by the FDIC.

Anonymity
 Though each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public
log, names of buyers and sellers are never revealed –
only their wallet IDs. While that keeps bitcoin users’
transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything
without easily tracing it back to them. That’s why it has
become the currency of choice for people online buying
drugs or other illicit activities.
